        I seek to ground my classes in the traditional teachings and to honor the people and land that bore them.
        Yoga to meet your body where it ever-so-perfectly is in this moment of your pregnancy journey.
        This can look vastly different depending on what is needed, from a warmth building flow to guided meditation wrapped in blankets and seated on bolsters.
        These classes are a gentle invitation to build somatic awareness, nourish the nervous system, and hopefully tap into the life force energy that carries you through labor and birth, and countless moments beyond.
        My highest intention is to create a space for you to encounter your own heart, and find a personal practice that goes with you when you step off the mat.

        <h3>PRENATAL</h3>
        This class is created for blooming bodies within the pregnancy window.
        Not only physically safe, this is a warm container to be held and acknowledged in your expansion with other mamas.
        Guided meditation, breath work and movement alchemize stagnant energy in the body, ground a restless mind, and pull you into your heart space.
        Whether you have a long history with these modalities or have never meditated before, this class welcomes you to dip your toes and find what resonates with you.

        <h3>RESTORATIVE</h3>
        Actively recover from over-stimulation, stress, and any high intensity exercise.
        Realities which we all contend with day to day.
        This is an opportunity to slow down as much as possible, and allow the brain to drop into theta wave state.
        Paired with long held poses supported by props, the body and nervous system can be suspended in a place of deep relaxation.
        This class is for everyone, and also safe for pregnancy.
