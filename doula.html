        <h3>Current Postpartum Doula Offerings</h3>
          Doulas are skilled helpers around the event of birth, who have existed since humans have had babies in community.
          They are familiar with the territory, and contribute effectively in the ways unique to each person and family.
          It is a collaborative effort to help identify, establish and integrate flow in the home.
          I envision a return to past traditions where assistance was inherent to the experience of being in a family system or a community.
          Until that time comes, and in order for it to do so, we must actively call upon others for care.
          I see this as both the most vulnerable and strong thing a human can do.
          My intention is to help facilitate an empowered, integrated and whole postpartum journey.

        <h3>Services</h3>
          These will vary depending on what is needed.
          From spiritual and emotional support in the form of private yoga, ceremony, or home cleansing, to practical daily life realities like loading the dishwasher.
          We will work together to create a plan that fits your individual needs.
          The beauty of this service is that I am prepared to step into the dynamic situation and hold you and your family in a way which is appropriate and helpful.
